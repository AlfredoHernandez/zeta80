zeta80 is a Z80 CPU emulation library.

This project aims to build just another Z80 emulation platform by creating an
emulation library that can be linked against other software built on top of
this library.

Why to write another library? For educational purposes, of course. This is my
attempt on learning how to deal with large C projects where library and binary
are separate entities. Also it's my first time using CMake building system.

This code is being developed as part of a live coding playlist, merging
software development and live streaming on YouTube. You can check out the
complete videos where I develop this library on my YouTube channel, at
