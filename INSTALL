Just give up at the moment. There is no proper way for installing this and
if I were you I'd just download another Z80 library instead of using this.

You can build libzeta80 as a static library using the following commands:

	cmake ..
	make
	make install

If you want to override default installation path you might run cmake as

	cmake .. -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=$mydir

where $mydir is the desired location where you want the project to be
installed. Please note that $mydir should be a root folder for other 
directories such as $mydir/bin, $mydir/lib, $mydir/include... example
locations are /usr, /usr/local... don't use a directory such as
/usr/local/bin as your install directory, you will end up with things
installed to /usr/local/bin/bin, /usr/local/bin/lib and so.

This INSTALL file is definitely a draft. As the project grows I'll write
some proper documentation when everything is ready to go.
