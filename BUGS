Reporting bugs.-

PLEASE NOTE
    This is an unstable project in an early development stage.
    Project is active and things change often. Think twice
    before reporting bugs at this stage as they are probably
    being worked on anyway.

    If you find a bug on the emulator, you can report it at the issue
    tracker for this project, which is located on GitHub, at
        
        http://github.com/danirod/zeta80

    Please, only report bugs that can be reproduced. Report the steps
    required to reproduce the bug, as well as the environment (operating
    system, processor) you are running the emulator in.
